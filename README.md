Welcome to scratch math! feel free to test out the extension, look at the code, provide suggestions, or ask for help

vectors are represented as a string seperated by commas like this: "1,2,3"

list are represented as a string seperated by spaces like this: "1 2 3" and this: "1,2,3 4,5,6 7,8,9"

for each argument of the operators, you can use a number, vector, or list

the Cross product doesn't take numbers, only vectors

the "size of" block tells you how many elements are in a list

this "length of" block tells you magnitude of a vector
